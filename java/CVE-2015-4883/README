RMI-SocketFactory:
	Full Security Bypass
	Privileged Deserilization

This POC targets a vulnerability in the RMI framework that leads to a privileged deserialization of a user controlled object.

	The vulnerability exists because the RMI framework creates a privileged thread to perform dirty
calls to a remote server. A chain of RMI objects can be created using object deserialization to create
the necessary thread and stack frames to perform proper deserialization of a user controlled object.
