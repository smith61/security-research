CORBA-SF:
	Denial Of Service
	Improper Deserialization

This POC targets a vulnerability in the CORBA framework to cause the JVM to segfault.

	The vulnerability exists because the CORBA framework improperly deserializes a String object when invoked through a ValueHandler instance. The CORBA framework creates a String object with a null character array. Any native call that utilizes this string, such as "intern" causes the JVM to segfault.
