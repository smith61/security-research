CORBA-TC:
	Full Security Bypass
	Type Confusion

This POC targets a vulnerability within the CORBA framework to cause type confusion.

The specific vulnerability exists because IIOPInputStream does not properly validate
that the "currentClassDesc" field describes the same type as the object in the
"currentObject" field. By calling "defaultReadObject" from within a constructor
of another object allows you to trick IIOPInputStream into placing objects of the wrong
type into a field.
