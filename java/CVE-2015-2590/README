OIS-CNFE:
	Full Security Bypass
	Type Confusion Vulnerability.

This POC targets a vulnerability within ObjectInputStream to bypass the protections put in place for CVE-2012-0507.

	The specific vulnerability exists because the internal stream state can be reset by reading in an exception. This is allows you to replace internal state and objects in the handles table. It is also coupled with ObjectInputStream resorting to default deserialization for objects whose parents threw a ClassNotFoundException. This allows you to bypass the "readObject" method of AtomicReferenceArray and achieve type confusion.
