MBean-ServerConnection:
	Full Security Bypass
	Privileged Object Deserialization

This POC targets a vulnerability within the RMI framework that leads to a privileged deserialization of user controlled objects.

	This vulnerability exists because the RMI framework deserializes user controlled data. A privileged method
chain can be created leading to the deserialization of user controlled data.
