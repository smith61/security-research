RMI-Activation:
	Full Security Bypass
	Privileged Deserialization

This POC targets a vulnerability within the RMI framework that leads to a privileged deserialization of a user controlled object.

	The vulnerability exists because ActivatableRef deserializes user controlled data. A privileged method chain can be created that leads to this method causing a user controlled object to be privilegedly deserialized.
