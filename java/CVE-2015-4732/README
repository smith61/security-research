OIS-Race:
	Full Security Bypass
	Type Confusion Vulnerability

This POC targets a vulnerability within ObjectInputStream to bypass the protections put in place for CVE-2012-0507.

	The specific vulnerability exists because ObjectInputStream is not thread safe. A race exists when accessing the
"curContext" field. When on thread sets the field an invokes an object's "readObject" method, another thread can change
the field causing the "readObject" method to fail but the context to remain valid. You can then default deserialze the
object. This can be used to bypass the "readObject" method of AtomicReferenceArray to achieve type confusion.
